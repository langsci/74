The completion of this project was dependent upon a multitude of factors, the 
most important being  the  knowledge and generosity of local residents 
whose mother 
tongue is Chakali. I am  indebted to  Daniel Kanganu Karija,   Fuseini Mba 
Zien, 
Afia Kala Tangu,  Awie Bakuri Ahmed,   Baaba Tangu, Seidu Kassim Tangu, Henry 
Seidu Daannaa, Godfrey Bayon Tangu,  Kpersi-Naa, Kotia Nwabipe, Amoa Bari-Naa,  
and Sakara Baduong, among many others,  for their instructions and 
enlightenments. 
I owe a special thanks to Daniel Kanganu Karija and  Fuseini Mba Zien for their 
loyal contribution since the very beginning of my learning journey. A special 
thank you goes  to 
Jonas Kpierekoh, a specialist in agroforestery and principal programme officier 
at the  Environmental Protection Agency, who spent time with me and 
local experts in Ducie working out the scientific name of many 
tree species.  With 
immense gratitude, I 
want to thank everyone in the villages where I stayed -- especially Ducie and 
Gurumbele --  for their warm welcome 
and 
cooperation. 

I should like to express my warm thanks to  Mary Esther Kropp Dakubu,  for her 
guidance, support,  advice,  and  linguistic insight throughout the years.   I 
wish to thank Eva LÃ©onie Mutuzo, Benjamin Waldron,  Felix K. Ameka,  Kaja 
Borthen, Albert 
Awedoba,  Tyson Farrell, Lars Hellan, and Assibi Apatewon Amidu who kindly 
suggested 
corrections, and commented on  earlier versions.  Thanks as well to many people 
on the mailing list of the FieldWorks Language Explorer software, and  
Sebastian Nordhoff at  Language Science Press,  for helping me with 
technical details. [add reviewers and series editor]
